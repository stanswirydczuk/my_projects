                  The popularity of anime can vary over time and across different regions. As of my
                  last knowledge update in January 2022, here are some anime series that were widely
                  considered popular:
                  
               </p>
               
               <ol>
                  <li>Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin)</li>
                  <li>Demon Slayer (Kimetsu no Yaiba)</li>
                  <li>My Hero Academia (Boku no Hero Academia)</li>
                  <li>One Punch Man</li>
                  <li>Naruto / Naruto Shippuden</li>
                  <li>Dragon Ball series (Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball Super)</li>
                  <li>Death Note</li>
                  <li>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</li>
                  <li>One Piece</li>
                  <li>Tokyo Ghoul</li>
               </ol>
               
               <p>
                  Keep in mind that the popularity of anime can change, and new series may have gained
                  popularity since my last update. Additionally, individual preferences play a significant
                  role in determining what someone considers the "most popular" anime. You might want
                  to check more recent sources for the latest trends in anime popularity. Websites like
                  MyAnimeList, Crunchyroll, and AniList often provide updated rankings and user ratings
                  for anime series.
