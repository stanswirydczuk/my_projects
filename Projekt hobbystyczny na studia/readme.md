### What's in the source files folder?

In the source files folder I included all the source files for the website as well as the virtual machine operating debian 32-bit. The machine is set-up for the purposes of this project.

***

### What was your motivation?

Since the theme of this project was supposed to be the creator's hobby I decided to go for anime. Anime's been a hobby of mine for quite some time now so it's only fair I chose it as the trope for my work.

***

### Why did you build this project?

This project was a part of two of my classes. Both had to do with web development and their names were respectively **Wytwarzanie aplikacji internetowych** oraz **Hipertekst i hipermedia**.

***

### What problem does it solve?

The project's main focus isn't to solve a problem. It does inform the reader on some fun facts regarding anime and the Japanese culture. Nevertheles the ulterior motive for building this project was to display a cool looking gallery of all my favorite animes.

***

### What did you learn?

In this project I used tools such as:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- external JS plugins
- XML
- XSD 
- XSLT
- PHP
- MangoDB
- Oracle's VM VirtualBox

Getting to work on this project with so many different tools at my disposal definitely taught me a lot on how to use them and when to use them.

**Side note:** there aren't any *comments* in the project source files because they were *not allowed* by our professors for presentation purposes.
