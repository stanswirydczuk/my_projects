        Keep in mind that the popularity of anime can change, and new series may have gained popularity since my last update. Additionally, individual preferences play a significant role in determining what someone considers the "most popular" anime. You might want to check more recent sources for the latest trends in anime popularity. Websites like MyAnimeList, Crunchyroll, and AniList often provide updated rankings and user ratings for anime series.
